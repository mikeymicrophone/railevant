Railevant is an application that stores information about Rails and its ecosystem.

Each item can be stored as one of about 50 types of concepts, such as command, recipe, expression, incompatibility, 
convention, capability, debate, etc.  These all inherit from the same class so adding more is trivial.

These concepts can then be related to each other.  Because they are all stored in the same table, they all have unique 
ids and polymorphism is possible without storing class names.

To further improve performance, relationships are cached in both objects whenever two concepts are related to each 
other.

There is also a process by which a user can identify him or herself as one of the Railser objects if three other users 
confirm that their email address is actually in use by that person.

This was written early in the days of Rails 2.0 and may be ready for some updates.

Other than styling, it may be pretty much ready to hit the streets.  Let's make a documentation hub that is flexible 
enough to work!
