hi - hope you're well and the rails are treating you right.

would you please help us determine whether <%= @identity.content %> uses the email address <%= @railser.email %>?

someone using this address claimed that he was <%= @identity.content %> and we would like you to check for us.

thanks ever so much - we want you to know that when you get tips from the pros, they're just who you think they are.

visit <%= verify_url @railser, @code %> when you're confident that it's <%= @identity.content %>.
